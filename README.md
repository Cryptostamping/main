# Cryptostamping
The goal of Cryptostamping is to introduce authenticity & transparency in the digital world, a new system through which people can stamp and add value to their content, certify, show support, talk or comment.

The internet grows endlessly, and it is in much need of a system which can organize all this jumbled content, filter the spam & bot-gen, push up what is user-valued. And our goal is to make sure this power rest with the users, in a transparent & decentralized way. 

Thanks to the blockchain technology, all this is made possible now. Join us in building a better web experience.
